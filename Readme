## Overview
A simple Character Counter web app that instantly counts characters, words, spaces, and letter density as you type. Built with a clean UI and real-time updates, it helps writers, students, and professionals track text metrics effortlessly. 

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Analyze the character, word, and sentence counts for their text
- Exclude/Include spaces in their character count
- Set a character limit
- Receive a warning message if their text exceeds their character limit
- See the approximate reading time of their text
- Analyze the letter density of their text
- Select their color theme
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process
I first mentally broke down the problem. Even jotted down approaches i'd take to achieve a targeted result. Then I started coding, implementing the solutions I already planned in my head.   

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript
- tailwindcss for styles




### What I learned

Handling Letter density proved difficult. Prompting chatGPT provided working solutions

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:


```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
   // Sorting Letters by Frequency
  const sortedLetters = Object.entries(letterCounts).sort(
    (a, b) => b[1] - a[1]
  ); // converts the object to an array with key value pairs then sort
}
```


### Useful resources

- [chatGPT resource 1](https://chatgpt.com) - This was helpful particularly with letter density I initially had issues with.
